# OpenLife Language & Grammar

> Conventions that make writing clear, consistent, and ready for global audiences.

## Strategic Foundation

**Brand Alignment:** OpenLife's language conventions support our commitment to clarity and openness. Consistent grammar and style make content more accessible, easier to translate, and faster to read. These conventions reflect our refreshingly direct personality—we avoid unnecessary complexity and communicate with precision.

## Capitalization

### Sentence Case (Default)
Use sentence case for most content—capitalize only the first word and proper nouns.

| Element | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Headings | "Getting started with the platform" |
| Button labels | "Create new policy" |
| Menu items | "Account settings" |
| Tab labels | "Configuration" |
| Tooltips | "Click to expand details" |

### Title Case
Reserve title case for:
- Product names: "OpenLife Platform"
- Feature names (when branded): "Community Marketplace"
- Proper nouns and company names

### All Caps
Avoid all caps except for:
- Acronyms: API, AI, CLI, SDK
- Status labels (used sparingly): "BETA", "NEW"

### Specific Rules

| Term | Capitalization | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| OpenLife | OpenLife | Always capitalize both O and L |
| Platform | lowercase | Unless part of "OpenLife Platform" |
| community | lowercase | General reference |
| AI | uppercase | Acronym |
| open source | lowercase | Industry standard |
| source-available | lowercase | Hyphenated, lowercase |

## Punctuation

### Periods
- Use in complete sentences
- Omit in headlines, headings, and labels
- Omit in bulleted lists if items are fragments

### Commas
- Use the Oxford comma: "colors, typography, and spacing"
- Use after introductory phrases: "After setup, configure your environment."

### Apostrophes
- Use for contractions: "you're", "it's", "don't"
- Use for possessives: "the platform's API"
- Avoid in plural acronyms: "APIs" not "API's"

### Hyphens and Dashes
| Type | Usage | Example |
|------|-------|---------|
| Hyphen (-) | Compound modifiers | "AI-powered platform" |
| En dash (–) | Ranges | "Pages 10–15" |
| Em dash (—) | Emphasis/break | "Full control—no exceptions" |

### Colons
- Use to introduce lists
- Capitalize after only if followed by a complete sentence

### Quotation Marks
- Use double quotes for direct quotes and UI labels
- Place periods and commas inside quotes (US style)
- Use single quotes for quotes within quotes

## Abbreviations & Acronyms

### First Use
Spell out acronyms on first use with abbreviation in parentheses, unless universally known.

**Spell out first:**
> "The Command Line Interface (CLI) enables quick deployment."

**Universally known (no need to spell out):**
- API, AI, UI, URL, PDF, HTML, CSS, JSON

### Common OpenLife Terms

| Term | Full Form | Usage |
|------|-----------|-------|
| API | Application Programming Interface | No need to spell out |
| CLI | Command Line Interface | Spell out first time |
| SDK | Software Development Kit | Spell out first time |
| AI | Artificial Intelligence | No need to spell out |
| SSO | Single Sign-On | Spell out first time |

### Abbreviation Rules
- Don't abbreviate unless necessary
- Don't create new abbreviations without approval
- Don't use periods in acronyms: "API" not "A.P.I."

## Numbers & Units

### Numerals vs. Words

| Context | Style | Example |
|---------|-------|---------|
| One through nine | Spell out | "three options" |
| 10 and above | Numerals | "15 integrations" |
| Starting a sentence | Spell out | "Twelve insurers joined" |
| Technical values | Always numerals | "8px", "24-column grid" |
| Statistics/data | Always numerals | "5% growth" |
| Large numbers | Numerals + word | "1.2 million policies" |

### Percentages
- Use numerals with the % symbol: "25%"
- Spell out "percent" in running prose when not data

### Units
- Use standard abbreviations: px, rem, ms, KB, MB, GB
- No period after unit abbreviations
- Space between number and unit: "16 px" or "16px" (be consistent)

### Currency
- Use symbol before number: "$1,000"
- Use appropriate currency symbol for context
- For ranges: "$10–$50" or "$10 to $50"

### Phone Numbers
- US format: (555) 123-4567
- International: +1 555 123 4567

## Contractions

OpenLife uses contractions to maintain a conversational, approachable tone.

### Encouraged Contractions
- you're, you've, you'll, you'd
- we're, we've, we'll, we'd
- it's, that's, there's
- don't, doesn't, can't, won't, isn't, aren't

### Avoid
- Contractions that reduce clarity
- Excessive contractions in formal documentation
- Contractions in legal content

**Example:**
> "You're in control of your platform" ✓
> "You are in control of your platform" ✓ (for emphasis)

## Lists

### Bulleted Lists
- Use for unordered items
- Start each item with the same part of speech
- Use sentence fragments or complete sentences (not mixed)
- Punctuate consistently:
  - Fragments: no end punctuation
  - Sentences: end with periods

### Numbered Lists
- Use when order matters (steps, rankings)
- Use for lists that will be referenced by number

### Parallel Structure
Maintain grammatical consistency:

**Good:**
- Configure your environment
- Install dependencies
- Deploy the application

**Avoid:**
- Configure your environment
- Installing dependencies
- The application should be deployed

## Localization Considerations

### Write for Translation
- Use simple sentence structures
- Avoid idioms and culturally specific references
- Don't embed text in images
- Allow for text expansion (30-40% longer in some languages)
- Use Unicode-compatible formatting

### Avoid Ambiguity
- "You" should clearly refer to the reader
- Avoid pronouns with unclear antecedents
- Be explicit about subjects and objects

### Date, Time, and Numbers
- Use formats that can be easily localized
- Avoid hardcoding formats in code
- See [Date & Time](brand-elements-content-date-and-time.md) for details

### Terms to Localize Carefully
- Technical terms that may not have direct translations
- Brand-specific terminology
- Legal terms
