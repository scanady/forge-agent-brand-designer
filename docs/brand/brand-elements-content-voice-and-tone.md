# OpenLife Voice & Tone

> Content that speaks with confident clarity—technically credible, refreshingly direct, and empowering.

## Strategic Foundation

**Brand Alignment:** OpenLife's voice embodies The Liberator archetype—confident, collaborative, and empowering. We speak like the trusted advisor who tells you what you need to hear, not what vendors want you to believe. Our voice remains consistent, while our tone adapts to context and user needs.

## Voice vs. Tone

| Aspect | Definition | Consistency |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| **Voice** | Who we are—our personality in words | Always consistent |
| **Tone** | How we express ourselves in context | Adapts to situation |

Think of voice as our personality, and tone as our mood. A person's personality stays the same, but their mood changes based on circumstances.

## Voice Characteristics

### Confident
We believe in our approach and state it clearly. We don't hedge or use weak language.

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| "Vendor lock-in is a choice—and you can choose differently." | "Vendor lock-in might perhaps be avoidable in some cases." |
| "You have the source code." | "You may have some level of access to certain code elements." |

### Collaborative
We emphasize community and shared success. We use "we" inclusively and avoid adversarial framing.

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| "When one insurer solves a problem, everyone benefits." | "We beat the competition by working together." |
| "Join the community building the future." | "Leave your vendor behind and join us." |

### Clear
No jargon, no fluff, no enterprise-speak. We write to be understood, not to impress.

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| "You have access to the source code. All of it." | "Gain comprehensive visibility into our codebase assets." |
| "Deploy in minutes." | "Facilitate rapid implementation timelines." |

### Credible
We're technically grounded and specific. We prove claims with evidence and examples.

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| "Our pluggable architecture uses standardized APIs." | "Our innovative platform is best-in-class." |
| "Deploy to cloud or your data center—your choice." | "We offer flexible deployment options." |

### Energizing
We're optimistic about transformation and excited about what we're building together.

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| "The next decade of insurance technology doesn't have to look like the last." | "Change is difficult but necessary." |
| "Let's build it differently." | "Consider exploring alternative approaches." |
